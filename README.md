This repository contains code and data to accompany the following preprint:

Theng, M., Prowse, T. A. A., Delean, S., Cassey, P. and Bracis, C. (2021), The integrated role of resource memory and scent-based territoriality in the emergence of home-ranges. bioRxiv 2021.05.07.443202. https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.05.07.443202

This repository contains the R code for calculating output metrics from movement simulation datasets and analyses of those output metrics. Please refer to `MetadataS1.pdf` for file-specific information. 

The code for movement simulations are associated with another repository (https://github.com/cbracis/ForagingModel/releases/tag/v1.0).
